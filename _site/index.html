You may be in a completely different field and wondering about how to get started in tech or how viable those tech bootcamps are. You may be gearing up to go to your first hackathon. You may be trying to get more twitter followers! </p>

      Hi! My name is Gunes and I'm from Istanbul. I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science at NYU. I'm interested in the intersection of technology and strategy. Other than Tech@NYU, I'm also in the e-board of Stern Management Consulting Group and Turkish Political Society. I'd like to pursue technology consulting upon graduation. Some of my hobbies are running, cooking, and traveling.
      can talk about: For those who want to pursue a career in business/finance/consulting rather than engineering, it's important to know how to use your technical skills in the business world. I'd like to advise you on how to your STEM major for recruiting and how to use your coding skills outside of classroom.

      I have held a number of internships in various fields, ranging from public relations and marketing to tech and finance. I am interested in helping people in business, communications, etc. who lack technical skills engage with the tech industry. My hobbies include following the news, running, and vintage shopping. I am excited by this initiative because I love giving advice to others and learning about what they're working on and passionate about!
      can talk about: The intersection of tech and communications/marketing; working in tech without knowing how to code

      I'm a student from the Philippines studying Computer Science. Outside of CS, I enjoy eating, photography, and yoga. I used to intern at an NYC startup and Adobe on the Behance team doing Software Engineering. This summer I'll be interning at Etsy as a Software Engineer on the Stats and Product Architecture team. I'm quite close to the CS professors on the 4th floor (I know, very specific) since I am part of Women in Computing (WinC), and we have an office in the Math building. In fact, I used to be the President of WinC! I'm also involved with Tech@NYU and previously lead Startup Week and the Freshman Circuit.
      can talk about: - Software Engineering internships and job hunting- Interview prep for software engineering- Tech@NYU and WinC- Being friends with your professors- Hackathons- Starting in Computer Science- Networking- Ladies in tech- Visa issues

I'm also working on an honors thesis that examines the impact of extracurricular activity on academic performance and job placement.Outside of university, I dance hip-hop and make drone videos with my twin brother.
